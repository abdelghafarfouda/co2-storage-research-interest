# CO₂ storage: predicting pressure and plume migration, and what monitoring can confirm

I want to study how reservoir pressure and CO₂ movement change during injection and after it stops, and how monitoring can help us check our predictions.

These four notebooks show how I would approach that question using computational mathematics, data science and machine learning, deep learning, and seismic methods. Each notebook uses small worked examples to explain a method, test it, and show where it could help with the engineering problem.

The examples support a research proposal. The deep-learning model is untrained, and the full simulation, training and monitoring studies are proposed future work.

This repository adapts my own work in computational mathematics, data science and machine learning, deep learning, and seismic to a CO₂ storage research question. External methods, software, datasets and any specifically identified supplied material are credited where used.

## The four notebooks

The formal question of my PhD research proposal (draft v0.6.3) is:

> **How reliably can reservoir pressure and CO₂ plume migration be predicted through injection and after shut-in, and what can pressure and seismic monitoring confirm about those predictions?**

Reservoir engineering and physical modelling are the core: pressure build-up and fall-off, a CO₂ inventory that must add up, and the physics of what gauges and time-lapse seismic can see. Each area answers one step of the question and measures one term of an *error budget*: the separate sources of error, each measured on the same quantities.

| Area | Notebook | Engineering question | Method | Error-budget term |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Computational Mathematics | [01](notebooks/01_computational_mathematics_reference_checks.ipynb) · WP1 | Is the reference simulation right, and how wrong is it? | Verification: known answers, grid refinement and a mass balance | `e_num`, `e_mf` |
| Data Science and Machine Learning | [02](notebooks/02_data_science_fair_tests.ipynb) · WP2 | Are the tests of a fast model fair, and how much geological uncertainty must a forecast resolve? | Test design: splits by realisation, paired shift cases, matched tuning budgets | `u_geo` |
| Deep Learning | [03](notebooks/03_deep_learning_surrogate.ipynb) · WP3 | Can a fast network (a *surrogate*) replace the simulator, and how is that judged? | An untrained recurrent U-Net with built-in physical constraints; tests of accuracy and coverage | `e_sur` |
| Seismic | [04](notebooks/04_seismic_monitoring_sensitivity.ipynb) · WP4 | What can time-lapse seismic see of a CO₂ layer? | Rock physics, synthetic traces and singular values | `e_obs` |

## What is here, and what is not

Each notebook opens with a short introduction to its question, method and purpose. Then come (1) my work in that area; (2) how it is adapted to the CO₂ problem; (3) the worked examples, which run in seconds, each followed by how to read its result and what it means for the PhD; (4) how the work package will be evaluated, with the detailed rules; (5) assumptions and what has to change; and (6) a short status line with references. Each part carries one of four labels:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **My work** | My own earlier work: implementations, completed exercises, analysis and explanations |
| **Proposed adaptation** | What I plan to do in the PhD. Not done yet |
| **Implemented example** | New code written for this repository, run on a textbook or toy problem, or on an untrained network |
| **Evaluated result** | A tested research result. **There are none yet** |

The examples illustrate methods and checks. No reservoir simulation has been run for this project, and the numbers come from toy inputs, so they are not research findings. My original notebooks are not reproduced here; the four notebooks are new adaptations of that work.

## From my work to evaluation

Where each method appears, as notebook section and cell id (cell ids are stored in the notebooks, so a link such as `nb03-s6-known` finds the cell).

## Key terms and rules from the proposal

The notebooks explain each term in plain words where it first appears and refer to sections of the proposal, which is not included in this repository. Its main terms and rules are:

- **Decision quantities.** P1 peak bottom-hole pressure during injection; P2 average overpressure at shut-in, +5 and +10 years; P3 overpressure below the caprock and at a distant point; P4 time for overpressure to halve after shut-in; M1 CO₂ mass by state (mobile, immobile, dissolved); M2 plume footprint above a saturation threshold; M3 maximum up-dip migration distance.
- **CO₂ inventory.** `M_inj(t) = M_mob(t) + M_imm(t) + M_diss(t) + M_out(t)`, where `M_out` is cumulative outflow across the model edge (zero for a closed boundary, and wherever the chosen boundary representation lets no CO₂ cross).
- **Error budget.** `u_geo` spread across the geological prior; `e_num = R_h − R∞`, production-grid reference minus refined reference; `e_mf` differences between model levels; `e_sur = S − R_h`, surrogate minus reference; `e_obs` effect of rock-physics and noise choices. `R∞` estimates the converged solution of the model equations, and the surrogate's error against it is `S − R∞ = e_sur + e_num`. This is measured only on refined realisations; elsewhere it is estimated by an error indicator, which is checked on held-out refined realisations and is not a bound.
- **Rules.** R1 a difference between methods is claimed only if a paired 95 % bootstrap interval excludes zero; R2 an advantage seen only against `R_h` and smaller than `|e_num|` is not claimed; R3 a surrogate is fit for a quantity only where the 90th percentile of `|S − R∞|` over refined test realisations is below [0.2] `u_geo`, and a verdict that rests on the indicator, or on a shift without refined cases of that shift, is reported as provisional; R4 model choice is reported as controlling where `e_mf` dominates; R5 every term is reported before and after shut-in.
- **Usefulness tests.** U1 accuracy (R3); U2 added value over the best simpler method at the same tuning budget; U3 lower total cost, training data included, than an equally accurate coarse-grid simulation; U4 the same ranking of operating schedules as the reference.
- **Coverage target.** At least 0.90 of test realisations inside a simultaneous band for their whole post-shut-in trajectory, judged with a 95 % Clopper–Pearson interval.
- **Cases.** A, assessment (rate and duration within pressure limits); B, operation (ranking injection schedules); C, monitoring (which data narrow forecasts, and whether they reveal a wrong boundary).

Values in square brackets are placeholders to be set with a supervisor before any results exist.

## How to run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdelghafarfouda/co2-storage-research-interest.git
cd co2-storage-research-interest
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install torch==2.14.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu   # optional: the much smaller CPU-only PyTorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab                          # then open a notebook and run all cells
```

Everything runs on a CPU, and the four notebooks together take under a minute. Random seeds are fixed in the code (mostly 42), so the printed numbers repeat. Only Notebook 03 needs PyTorch.

The notebooks use NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib and PyTorch. They were last run from a clean kernel with Python 3.11.15 and the package versions in `requirements.txt`. Methods, papers and other sources are cited at the end of each notebook.

## How these materials were prepared

This repository adapts my earlier work to a CO₂ storage research question. I used AI tools to help prepare the new notebooks and explanations.
